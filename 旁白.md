Alright, letâ€™s set the record straight:

1. **Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Tony Stark (Iron Man) are FAKE people.**  
   - They donâ€™t exist. They are **comic book characters** created by DC and Marvel, respectively.  
   - No billionaire is out here dressing as a bat and fighting crime at night.  
   - No genius playboy is casually building an AI-powered metal suit to save the world.  

2. **Poor Spider-Man got rigged.**  
   - Unlike Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark, Peter Parker actually struggles with money, rent, and real-life problems.  
   - Even though heâ€™s the most selfless hero, heâ€™s constantly getting screwed overâ€”whether itâ€™s by J. Jonah Jameson, his own bad luck, or writers who refuse to let him be happy.  
   - Meanwhile, Batman and Iron Man just throw money at their problems.  

So yeah, Spider-Man got the short end of the stick while the billionaire heroes get to shine. **Justice for Peter Parker!** ðŸ˜‚
